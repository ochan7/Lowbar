# Lowbar

My personal project to make a clone of some popular methods from [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), a commonly used bundle of functions for Javascript.

## Setup and Installation
---
1. Make sure that you have version 7 or above of node. Open your terminal and type and run.
```node -v```
This command will return the version of node you are running. If you do not get a reponse of the form
```vX.X.X```
or your version is not up to date, please refer to this [guide](https://nodejs.org/en/) on how to install node.
2. Make sure that you have npm installed, which is a [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Check by typing in yor terminal and running.
```npm -v```
This command will tell you which version of npm you have. You can update your version of npm by typing in the terminal and running.
```npm i npm```
3. Make sure that you have git installed on your computer. You can check by typing and running in your terminal
```git --version```
which you return a response in the form.
```git version x.xx.x```
Please click on this [link](https://git-scm.com/) if you do not have it installed. Then run this command in the terminal in the directory where you want it installed.
```git clone https://github.com/ochan7/Lowbar.git```
Then navigate inside the Lowbar folder and run this command.
``` npm install ```
4. To run the tests please run this command.
``` npm t ```
